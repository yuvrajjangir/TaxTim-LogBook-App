## Tech Stacks Used

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Server: Node.js


# <span style="color:red"> Details of Tech stack used: </span>

1. **Frontend**:
   - **Framework**: React
   - **Description**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides efficient rendering performance. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to manage the application's state and data flow.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Framework**: Express.js
   - **Description**: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building APIs and handling HTTP requests, making it well-suited for developing the backend of web applications.

3. **Database**:
   - **Database**: MongoDB
   - **Description**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It offers high scalability and flexibility, making it suitable for applications with rapidly evolving data requirements. MongoDB's document model allows for seamless integration with JavaScript-based applications and simplifies the development process.

4. **Server**:
   - **Runtime Environment**: Node.js
   - **Description**: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and efficient web applications. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and perfect for data-intensive real-time applications. Node.js enables the execution of JavaScript code on the server, allowing for full-stack JavaScript development.

Let us share our experience,<br>
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. there were some more functionalities that could have been done, yeah the time didn’t permit us to go further. But we will surely improve it during the course of time in future .

## So jurney started from here!

# <span style="color:red">Project Journey: </span>
During the Construct Week, I embarked on the development journey of creating the TaxTim Logbook app. The journey spanned seven days of intense coding, problem-solving, and collaboration. Here's a brief overview of the key milestones and challenges encountered during the project:

### Day 1: Project Inception
- Conducted initial brainstorming sessions to define the scope and objectives of the TaxTim Logbook app.
- Discussed and finalized the tech stack to be used for frontend, backend, and database.
- Set up the project repository, created the basic folder structure, and initialized the frontend and backend frameworks.

### Day 2-4: Frontend Development
- Focused on designing the user interface and implementing the core features of the frontend using React.
- Created reusable components for various UI elements such as forms, buttons, and navigation bars.
- Implemented user authentication functionality to enable secure user sign-up and login.

### Day 5-6: Backend Development
- Developed the backend infrastructure using Express.js to handle API requests and interact with the MongoDB database.
- Implemented endpoints for user authentication, expense management, and dashboard functionalities.
- Integrated middleware for error handling, request validation, and authentication verification.

### Day 7: Testing and Deployment
- Conducted rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs, ensure cross-browser compatibility, and optimize performance.
- Deployed the application to a cloud hosting platform such as Heroku or AWS for public access.
- Prepared the README file, including project description, tech stack details, and project journey.
- Celebrated the successful completion of the TaxTim Logbook app and reflected on the lessons learned throughout the development process.

The journey of building the TaxTim Logbook app was challenging yet rewarding, as it provided valuable insights into full-stack web development, collaboration, and problem-solving. I look forward to further refining and enhancing the application in future iterations.
